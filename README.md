# MultiThreading-MapReduce
Tools n Techniques Assignment1
Modify this code so that it makes use of multithreading
Modify your solution for b) so that a Java 8 lambda expression is used instead of an object of an anonymous class.
use an “emulated” MapReduce approach to compute the result. Your program doesn’t need to perform real MapReduce 
(don’t use, e.g., Hadoop or multiple machines!), just try to create and apply MapReduce methods map and reduce so that your approach 
resembles the real MapReduce approach described in the lecture as closely as possible (including use of parallelism where appropriate).
